# BrightMart-Stores_-Sales_Analysis
## Project Objectives
 - Analyze Sales Performance: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, total profit, customer count, and average order value.
 - Identify Trends: Examine monthly and quarterly revenue trends to understand seasonal and regional variations.
 - Evaluate Product Performance: Determine top-performing product categories and best-selling items by revenue and profit.
- Understand Customer Behavior: Analyze customer demographics, spending patterns, and preferences.
 - Provide Actionable Insights: Offer recommendations to optimize inventory management, improve customer retention, and boost sales in low-performing regions


## Data Description
- Product categories and subcategories
- Customer demographics (age, gender, region)
- Sales performance metrics (revenue, profit, cost)
- Seasonal and regional sales trends


  ## Tools & Techniques Used
- Power Query:
    - Cleaned and transformed raw sales data.
    - Handled missing values and reformatted columns for better analysis.
 - Power Pivot & DAX:
    - Created relationships between datasets for dynamic analysis.
     - Used DAX formulas to create calculated columns and measures.
     - Implemented DAX functions to segment customers into different age groups, enabling deeper insights into customer behavior.
- Pivot Tables & Charts:
  
  - Visualized sales trends, customer demographics, and product performance
  - Analyzed key metrics such as revenue by age group, customer purchase frequency, and product category performance.


 ## Insights
-  High Revenue Dependence on Bikes:
   
    - The Bikes category significantly outperforms other product categories in both revenue and profit, indicating heavy reliance on a single product line.
- Age Group 18-34 Dominates Sales:
  
     - Customers in the 18-34 age group contribute the most to total sales, while the 55+ age group has the lowest engagement, suggesting a generational purchasing gap.
- Revenue is Geographically Concentrated:
  
     - The United States contributes the highest revenue, while countries like France and Canada have relatively low revenue, indicating potential for expansion in underperforming regions.
- Seasonal Fluctuations in Order Quantity:
  
  - There are noticeable spikes and drops in average order quantity over the years, suggesting the influence of seasonality or promotional campaigns.
- Top Customers Drive a Large Portion of Revenue:
  
    - A small group of top customers generate a significant portion of the revenue, emphasizing the importance of customer retention strategies
 

## Recommendations
- Diversify Product Category Strength:

    - Introduce marketing campaigns to boost Accessories & Clothing sales to reduce over-reliance on Bikes.
- Target Older Demographics with Personalized Offers:

    - Implement age-specific promotions and advertising strategies to attract customers aged 45+.
- Expand Market Reach in Underperforming Regions:

     - Develop localized marketing strategies for France, Canada, and other low-performing regions to increase sales.
- Optimize Seasonal Promotions:

    - Use historical trend analysis to predict demand spikes and introduce timely promotions to maximize sales during peak seasons.
- Enhance Customer Retention Strategies:

    - Implement loyalty programs, personalized discounts, and exclusive deals for top customers to increase repeat purchases.
